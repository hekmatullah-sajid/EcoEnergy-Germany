# EcoEnergy-Germany

Welcome to EcoEnergy-Germany! This project focuses on exploring and analyzing renewable energy power plants in Germany. It is part of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp course and aims to provide insights into the renewable energy landscape in Germany through data engineering and visualization techniques.

## Dataset Information

This project utilizes a dataset containing a comprehensive list of renewable energy-based power plants in Germany. The dataset includes information about various renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, hydro, and biomass. The data is sourced from [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](link_to_dataset) course materials.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to build an end-to-end data pipeline to process, analyze, and visualize the data from renewable power plants in Germany. This involves setting up data lakes, creating pipelines for data processing and transformation, integrating with data warehouses, and building interactive dashboards for visualization.
